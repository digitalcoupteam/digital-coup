                    <h4>A player may choose any action they want and can afford.</h4>
                    <p>Some actions (character actions) require influencing characters.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>If they choose a Character Action a player must claim that the rquired character is one of their
                        face down cards. They can be telling the truth OR bluffing.</h4>
                    <p>They do not need to reveal any of their face down cards unless they are challenged. If they are not
                        challenged they automatically succeed.</p>
                    <p>If a player starts their turn with 10 (or more) coins they must launch an Overthrow that turn as
                        their ONLY action.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>General Actions</h4>
                    <h5>Income</h5>
                    <p>Take 1 coin from the Treasury</p>
                    <h5>Foreign Aid</h5>
                    <p>Take 2 coins from the Treasury (can be blocked by the Duke)</p>
                    <h5>Overthrow</h5>
                    <p>Pay 7 coins to the Treasury and Overthrow another player. That player immediately loses an
                        influence. An Overthrow is ALWAYS successful. If a turn is started with 10 or more coins, the
                        launching of an Overthrow is required</p>
                    <h4>Character Actions</h4>
                    <h5>The Duke - Tax</h5>
                    <p>Take 3 coins from the Treasury.</p>
                    <h5>The Assassin - Assassinate</h5>
                    <p>Pay 3 coins to the Treasury and launch an assassination against another player. If successful that
                        player immediately loses an influence. (Can be blocked by Contessa)</p>
                    <h5>The Captain - Steal</h5>
                    <p>Take 2 coins from another player. If they only have 1 coin, take only 1. (Can be blocked by the
                        Ambassador OR the Captain).</p>
                    <h5>The Ambassador - Exchange</h5>
                    <p>Exchange cards with the Court. First take 2 random cards from the Court deck. Choose which, if any,
                        to exchange with your face down cards. Then return two cards to the Court deck.</p>
